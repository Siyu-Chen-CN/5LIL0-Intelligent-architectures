The `LoadData()` function loads the data into two separate arrays $X$ and $Y$. We can determine the number of samples we want for training and testing our network with the `samples` input value.

Therefore, neurons move the input value of one layer to the next layer. Mathematically, the MLP model defines a parameterized function in which each layer computes a weighted linear combination, $h =XW+b$ of the layer input denoted by the vector $X$, followed by an activation function $\\sigma(h)$. MLP configuration can be repeatedly chained to build a deep neural network (DNN).\n",

    "### 5.2 Backpropagation\n",
    "To perform GD for our example, we need to calculate the gradient $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial W^{(1)}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial W^{(0)}}$ for the weight matrices in the output and hidden layers, respectively (note that we drop the subscripts $t$ and $i$ to simplify the notation). Backpropagation is an algorithm to compute these gradients efficiently. To calculate $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(1)} }$, we use the chain rule:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(1)}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h^{(1)}}\\times \\frac{\\partial h^{(1)}}{\\partial W^{(1)}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\frac{\\partial h^{(1)}}{\\partial W^{(1)}} = O^{(1)}$ as $h^{(1)}=O^{(1)}W^{(1)}$.\n",
    "For  $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h^{(1)}}$, let's apply the chain rule again and define $\\delta_1$ which we will use later:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta_1 \\triangleq \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h^{(1)}} =  \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O^{(2)}} \\times  \\frac{\\partial O^{(2)}}{\\partial h^{(1)}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The term $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O^{(2)}}$ is the partial derivative of the cross entropy loss function with respect to the input of softmax function, and it is equal to $\\hat{y}-y$ (see the detailed explanation [here](https://www.mldawn.com/back-propagation-with-cross-entropy-and-softmax/)). Since $O^{(2)} = \\text{sigmoid}\\left(h^{(1)}\\right)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial O^{(2)}}{\\partial h^{(1)}} = \\text{sigmoid}\\left(h^{(1)}\\right)\\left(1-\\text{sigmoid}\\left(h^{(1)}\\right)\\right)$, which is the derivative of the sigmoid activation function with respect to its input (see the detailed explanation [here](https://scribe.esmailelbob.xyz/derivative-of-the-sigmoid-function-536880cf918e)). Therefore, putting everything together, we have that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(1)}} = {\\left(O^{(1)} \\right)}^{T} \\left(\\hat{y}-y\\right)\\text{sigmoid}\\left(h^{(1)}\\right)\\left(1-\\text{sigmoid}\\left(h^{(1)}\\right)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "__Note:__ for the derivative with respect to a matrix, we need to be careful about the matrix dimension. For details, we recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlcnxUlrtek&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU&index=5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to calculate $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(0)} }$ for the hidden layer in a similar way. Again, we apply the chain rule:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(0)}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h^{(0)}}\\times \\frac{\\partial h^{(0)}}{\\partial W^{(0)}}= {\\left(O^{(0)}\\right)}^{T} \\times \\delta_0\\\\\n",
    "\\delta_0 \\triangleq \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O^{(1)}} \\times \\frac{\\partial O^{(1)}}{\\partial h^{(0)}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O^{(1)}} \\times \\text{ReLU}'(h^{(0)}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\text{ReLU}'(h^{(0)}) = \\begin{cases} 0, & h^{(0)} \\leq 0, \\\\ 1, & h^{(0)} > 1,\\end{cases}$ is the derivative of the ReLU activation function with respect to its input. Continuing the chain rule and using $\\delta_2$ defined previously, we have:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O^{(1)}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h^{(1)}} \\times \\frac{\\partial h^{(1)}}{\\partial O^{(1)}} = \\delta_1 \\times \\left({W^{(1)}}\\right)^{T}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So, finally we have:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(0)}} = {\\left(O^{(0)}\\right)}^{T} \\times \\delta_1 \\times {\\left(W^{(1)}\\right)}^{T} \\times \\text{ReLU}'(h^{(0)}) \n",

    "### 5.4 Mini-batch gradient descent\n",
    "Batch gradient descent (GD) requires computing the gradient $\\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial W^{(l)}}$ for all $N$ samples in the training dataset before updating the weights. We employ a modified version of GD called mini-batch GD that uses non-overlapping subsets $\\mathbb{B}$ of the training set with $B$ samples instead of all $N$ samples to calculate the gradient and update the weights:\n",

    "At each step $k$ of mini-batch GD we use the model with the current set of internal parameters (weights in our example) to make predictions on $B$ samples, to compare the predictions to the real expected outcomes, to calculate the loss, and to use the loss to update the internal model parameters via backpropagation. Once all mini-batches are processed, a so-called training *epoch* has elapsed and we spit the training set into a new set of mini-batches to continue the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an implementation perspective, the training process is a nested for loop, where the outer loop iterates over the training epochs and the inner loop iterates of the mini-batches and updates the weights. Note that it is common to randomly shuffle the training samples at the end of each epoch to create different mini-batches in each epoch. In addition, we want to store and plot the training and test loss (averaged over training and test samples, respectively) and the training and test accuracy as a function of the number of epochs. These plots can help to diagnose whether the model is over- or underfitting, as well as whether various parameter choices are meaningful."
